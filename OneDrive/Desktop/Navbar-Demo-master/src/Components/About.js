                  We are a team of four members from SRM Institute of Science
                  and Technology, we all are creative people working in our
                  respective fields and trying to bring out the best possible
                  solutions for the world. In this project, we have created a
                  website that allows the resale of any event ticket by
                  converting them to NFTs which will ensure that the seller who
                  is in a dread emergency to sell the ticket as he is unable to
                  attend the event and also the buyers who were unable to buy
                  the tickets from the respective event website but want to
                  visit the event. We at DLeaf try to make this possible for all
                  users. There is also an option to host an event whose all the
                  tickets will be provided in the form of NFT.
